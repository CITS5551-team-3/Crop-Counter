# Crop-Counter

## Project Description
The aim of this project is to develop an automated system for counting the number of plants at an
early stage of growth in agricultural fields, focusing on crops such as barley or wheat. By leveraging
drone imagery and advanced image processing techniques, this system will offer a more efficient and
accurate alternative to manual counting methods.
